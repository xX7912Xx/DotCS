# 看看系统消息
看看我的世界发的系统消息数据包,这个你懂的。
这里是原样转发。
下面是部分参数定义：

```golang
// Text is sent by the client to the server to send chat messages, and by the server to the client to forward
// or send messages, which may be chat, popups, tips etc.
type Text struct {
	// TextType is the type of the text sent. When a client sends this to the server, it should always be
	// TextTypeChat. If the server sends it, it may be one of the other text types above.
	TextType byte
	// NeedsTranslation specifies if any of the messages need to be translated. It seems that where % is found
	// in translatable text types, these are translated regardless of this bool. Translatable text types
	// include TextTypeTip, TextTypePopup and TextTypeJukeboxPopup.
	NeedsTranslation bool
	// SourceName is the name of the source of the messages. This source is displayed in text types such as
	// the TextTypeChat and TextTypeWhisper, where typically the username is shown.
	SourceName string
	// Message is the message of the packet. This field is set for each TextType and is the main component of
	// the packet.
	Message string
	// Parameters is a list of parameters that should be filled into the message. These parameters are only
	// written if the type of the packet is TextTypeTip, TextTypePopup or TextTypeJukeboxPopup.
	Parameters []string
	// XUID is the XBOX Live user ID of the player that sent the message. It is only set for packets of
	// TextTypeChat. When sent to a player, the player will only be shown the chat message if a player with
	// this XUID is present in the player list and not muted, or if the XUID is empty.
	XUID string
	// PlatformChatID is an identifier only set for particular platforms when chatting (presumably only for
	// Nintendo Switch). It is otherwise an empty string, and is used to decide which players are able to
	// chat with each other.
	PlatformChatID string
	// Netease PlayerRuntimeID
	PlayerRuntimeID string
}
